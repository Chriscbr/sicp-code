# sicp-code
A collection of the code I wrote (or copied for tinkering) while reading SICP.

## Background

When I decided to writing some of the code for the exercises in SICP while reading, I initially chose a tool named DrRacket for its convenience and my past experience with it. As I understand it doesn't have Scheme natively, but there are some packages which are specifically designed for use with this book. That said, switching to scheme directly would have been helpful for latter parts of the book when language interpretation and compilation come into play.

Plenty of help came from reading the following sources, which I adapted and copied some code from for purely educational purposes:
